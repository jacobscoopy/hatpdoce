## Pentesting Report

### 1. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in WordPress due to unsafe processing of file names
  - [ ] Summary: WordPress performs insufficient validation on the file name of uploaded media types and in specific images.
    - Vulnerability types: xss
    - Tested in version: 4.5.3
    - Fixed in version: 4.6.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/860368247688658944/957111777890533416/CSEcomputerhackingproofididit.png
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: For the attack to succeed the following conditions have to be met:
- A WordPress admin uploads a malicious image file requested by a user this admin trusts or a popular malicious image that was spread via social media. This involves social engineering. In the Proof of Concept the file name cengizhansahinsumofpwn<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg was used.
- An attacker can now determine if the file name with which the malicious file is available on the WordPress site. With this information he can spread the URL to end users and the WordPress admin.
